              <p>I am from Louisiana, Woooh GO SAINTS! I love to read, some of my favorite books are 
                    'Rich dad Poor Dad' by Robert Kiyosaki and 'The Suble Art of Not Giving a F**k' by Mark Manson. My favorite
                    sport is basketball. In my free time I like to workout, watch movies, listen to podcast and read of course. 
                    I am currently an IT in the Coast Guard. I graduated from southern university with a BS degree in criminal 
                    justice, that i do not really use unfortantely. In college my first major was actually computer science and
                    for some odd yound and crazy reason i changed it. But like the old saying goes "Whats meant to be will be!". 
                    Which is why I would like to be apart of this program.
